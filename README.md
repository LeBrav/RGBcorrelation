# RGBcorrelation
In this project, given a large image representing a glass plate using a red, a green, and a blue filter, divide into 3 different images, and correlate these images to obtain a colour image.

I've also developed code to crop the borders of the image, using edge_detectors such as Sobel and Canny, and binary morphology.
